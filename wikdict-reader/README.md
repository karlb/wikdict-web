# What is WikDict Reader?

It can take existing texts and link dictionary entries to the items found in the text. WikDict Reader can
* use conjugated forms for lookup
* [split compound words](https://github.com/karlb/wikdict-compound) and look up the words separately if the complete compound is not in the dictionary
* look up multi word phrases (if those are in the dictionary)
* create results that can be used without requiring the user to install a dictionary
